# Hackathons, streamlined
## Goal
We want to provide hackathon organizers with a simple way to manage sponsors, hackers and projects. All in one centralized location.

## Objective
The same code running on the [production site](https://hackathon.stream) will be available in the [app repository](https://github.com/hackathon-stream/app). We will never charge free users, the only paid plans will provide white-label features. We can also work out custom plans (over 1000 people), if you [contact us](mailto:team@hackathon.stream)!
